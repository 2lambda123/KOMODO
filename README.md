# KOMODO
## An Open Nuclear Reactor Simulator and Reactor Core Analysis Tool 

**Documentation available at**: https://imronuke.github.io/KOMODO/

**Features:**
* Input is straightforward, modular and in a free-format form
* Solves both static and transient core problems **with or without TH feedback**
* Performs forward, adjoint and fixed-source calculations
* Performs calculations using branched cross sections data. An example of the library format can be seen [here](https://github.com/imronuke/KOMODO/blob/master/smpl/xsec/SERPENT_CMM/m40.tab)
* Critical boron concentration search
* Rod ejection simulation or Reactivity Initiated Accident (RIA)
* Solves multi-group of neutron energy
* Solves calculations with Assembly Discontinuity Factors (ADFs)
* CMFD accelerated using two-node problem non-linear iteration
* CMFD matrix is solved with the latest linear system solver: BiCGSTAB
* Thermal-hydraulics solutions are obtained by solving mass and energy conservation equations in an enclosed channel
* Three nodal kernels are available:
  * Traditional Finite Difference Method
  * Polynomial Nodal Method (PNM) which is equivalent to Nodal Expansion Method (NEM)
  * Semi-Analytic Nodal Method (SANM)

# KOMODO
KOMODO is an open nuclear reactor simulator and reactor core analysis tool that solves static and transient neutron diffusion equation for one, two or three dimensional reactor problems in Cartesian geometry. Currently, KOMODO uses Semi-Analytic Nodal Method (SANM) to spatially discretise the neutron diffusion equation. While theta method is used for the time discretisation.

KOMODO is also a great learning tool for reactor theory classes, and we have been striving hard to make the input is easy to create. Among KOMODO' main objectives is to make all nuclear engineering students have access on reactor simulator code for them to use, learn, and modify for their own purposes. It is open and completely free, so everyone has access to the source codes and and play with them.

# User Guides

Here you can find quick and complete guides on how to use KOMODO. Given you have background on nuclear engineering, **we believe you can create your own KOMODO input within minutes!**

# About KOMODO
KOMODO is continuation of [APDRES](https://github.com/imronuke/ADPRES) with intention that more contributors are expected to join on this project since KOMODO name is consdired more neutral and institution-independent.
